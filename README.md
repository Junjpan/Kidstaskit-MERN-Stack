# Kidstaskit-MERN-Stack
Kidstaskit is a simple yet effective web app that targets families who want to help their kids focus and target in on important school work and chores that need to be done. By doing so, children can be more focused and on task throughout the week, effectively making them better stewards of their time. Our web App also allows near-infinite customization (for tasks and rewards) and includes a reward system in which parents can reward hard work and kids can have fun spending their points earned.
